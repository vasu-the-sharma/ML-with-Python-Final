## Different_Machine_Learning_Algorithms

In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we learned in this course.

We load a dataset using Pandas library, and apply the following algorithms, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.

Different ML Algorithms applied in the notebooks:-

1. K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression

In this model, Logistic Regression out-performs every other model.
